    Use RubyModule.JavaClassKindOf fixes jruby/jruby#614
    
    I've changed all of the relevant cases of anonymous KindOf classes to
    use the new JavaClassKindOf. This cuts down on some of the noise
    produced by anonymous inner classes, especially given that these
    replacement points all had identical implementations.

    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

commit 330fef3b0fc18af477ccea19bd278669667f31bb
Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 12 14:49:29 2013 -0600

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Partial set of patches from Colin Barlett for #236.
    
    Fixes issues in RubyInteger and RubyFixnum wrt Java long overflow.
    
    Issues remain in RubyNumeric, based on Colin's test script, but he
    instructed me to ignore those patches for now.

    Fix JRUBY-6778
    
    Possible long integer overflow bug in Integer#succ in RubyInteger.java
    
    Normal Java math allowed incrementing to overflow to negative
    numbers. Replaced with a call to the same Fixnum#+ logic so
    overflow triggers Bignum. Patch mostly by Colin Bartlett.

        Fix remaining failures for test-all.
    
        * Disable CheckClassAdapter temporarily, since it disallows what should be valid JVM identifiers.
        * Use the presence of $RUBY$ in method name as an additional indicator that we're processing a compiled Ruby body during backtrace gathering.
        * Move some largely-static properties out of "init" target in build.xml, so they're available whether init is triggered or not (e.g. run.jvm.model).

        * tc_owned is a bad test and fails on system like OS X where (for some reason) / may be owned by user
        * test_trace_func had been hacked for a bad class result (Integer, instead of Fixnum)...fixed that

        Remaining fixes to get precompiled mode passing all our tests. Still some spec failures.
    
        * Bump up permgen max for test runs
        * Fix stack-based scope initialization to not leave an unused nil on stack
        * Ensure compiled method handles properly wrap pre/post logic for dummy and backtrace frames.
    
    commit 96bd3cbde91fc505b37ee13cbea6ffa3e8690c58
    Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
    Date:   Mon Oct 11 18:36:34 2010 -0500
    
        First fixes for backtrace branch in precompiled mode:
    
        * Add test-precompiled build target for running just precompiled
        * Eliminate extraneous toplevel scope being pushed for precompiled loads (because that logic is all in the generated "load" method now.
        * Add a new scope descriptor decoding path that properly sets up a toplevel scope

        Fixes to get specs a bit closer to running green.
    
        * Move pre/post logic for Script.load into generated code, so it's the same everywhere.
        * Make pre/post-load push a frame, so top-level of a script is always framed
        * Remove break handling from non-literal block call paths in CachingCallSite
        * Make sure all literal block calls are using CallSite.callIter, which handles break
        * Fix a bad test in testCompiler that needed visibility tweaks and framing
        * Add complete doco for CallSite
        * Fix Kernel#caller to trim from top of stack instead of bottom

        Performance changes for backtrace logic:
    
        * Back off using Java stack trace for Proc's to_s file+line, since it's prohibitively expensive
        * Move the Backtrace stack to being a fixed-size array of objects updated, rather than created, when a push happens

    Full implementation of 1.9 Complex/Rational. Those classes are _very_ tightly integrated with the rest of core library (Nil, Kernel, String, and all Numeric descendants). Lots of default behaviors are dramatically changed (e.g. 10 ** -5 returns Rational instance now) so it might be difficult to test it all at once. 1.9 Complex and Rational classes are not rubyspec compatible, we fail then the same way 1.9 does (in 1.9 mode, though jruby should fake requiring Complex and Rational then). 1.8 mode should stay unaffected.

    The RC3 Surprise!
    
    Allow annotation defined ruby methods to optionally specify ThreadContext as first parameter
    Convert easiest and most common methods to accept ThreadContext when method or child method can use context
    
    These changes give about 15% improvement on petstore bench and about 10% in ar-bench.  In ar-bench getCurrentContext calls go from 14 million down to 2 million.  The remaining calls largely can be removed but they were much more invasive.
    
    IRubyObject op_eqq and op_equal both not have ThreadContext consumer, but we could see no use of this in any extensions and figured it worth the trouble of converting.

    - Identified and extracted construction paths for class/module/singleton/IncludedModuleWrapper, now there's no unnecessary null checks or assignments in their constructors (they take very few arguments so even asserts are not needed).
    Each of those constructors have a comment what is it the responsible for, also, two RubyClass.newClass() and two RubyModule.newModule() methods have been extracted.
    - Fixed logic that sets the parent/constant for Modules, now matches MRI (only setConstant/getConstantAt are used here).
    - RubyClass rewritten, special attention has been put on allocation logic, now Class.new(...) doesn't fire a separate allocator class. (btw, logic of "class B < A;end" and "Class.new(A)" must be split since in second case superclass and allocator are not known until initialize is called). Class/Object allocation implementation mimics MRI's weirdest quirks in behavior, is _much_ simpler that it has been and much faster. This also allowed creation of generalized clone/dup implementations matching MRI. (only our special ivars need a care here).
    - Rewritten bootstrapping of Object/Class/Module.
    - Core classes (except Exception hierarchy, they should also be in future) are now cached in runtime (MRI caches them in static VALUE's like rb_cObject) Ruby.getClass(String), Ruby.getModule(String) and Ruby.getClassFromPath(String) should be used only by either interpreter or compiler and when the class name is not known at compile time.
    - Fixed and simplified nodes: classNode, moduleNode, sclassNode, defsNode. Compiler has been synchronized here as well.
    - No more __attached__ as ivar, it is now MetaClass field (which means lazy ivars for singletons). Compiler also updated.
    - added and dosumented isModule() to IRubyObject (isClass(), isSintleton() documented).
    - Fixed test_autoload test (Object.class_eval do;autoload :SomeClass, 'somefile';class SomeClass; end;end) should raise LoadError, now matches MRI.
    
    - Fixed a number of minor bugs:
       1.instance_eval, was creating a metaclass for Fixnum instances (also affected Symbol/FalseClass/TrueClass/NilClass)
       marshaler objects were kept in singleton classes
       Range.inspect, was modifying the begin field (when it was a String)
       Many bulletproofings in Marshal/Unmarshal (like unmarshaling an instance of nonexistant class), TypeErrors/ArgumentErrors matching MRI.
       Fiber.new in 1.9, doesn't call #initialize method by funcall, fixed
       number of method arity fixes and many methods are made fast now
       fixed initialize/initialize_copy logic, further simplification, no ClassCastExceptions possible now
       Fixed defineClass(under)/defineModule(under) logic
       bulletproofed cases such: class A;end;module A;end

    Big set of changes for marshalling bug JRUBY-472; getting closer to having things sorted out. One known failure in "ant
    test" is due to our modules defining methods on a singleton class, which appears to be incorrect and harder to fix. I'm

    My Laptop drive is sounding funny (dropping a little earlier than normal -- but completely safe)
    ReflectionCallback is simpler - removed some indirection levels and split out new dispatch mechanism as...
    new ReflectedMethod which has less levels of indirection than reflectioncallback and will replace it entriely once all builtin classes use MetaClasses.
    Many protocol conversion protocols are being followed.  Almost all in numerical methods and a few in array, pack.
    Several classes have been changed to have a FooMetaClass.
    'ant test' is running between 25-20% faster right now and this should increase as I convert more builtin classes
