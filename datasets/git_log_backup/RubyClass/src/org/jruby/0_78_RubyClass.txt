    Use RubyModule.JavaClassKindOf fixes jruby/jruby#614
    
    I've changed all of the relevant cases of anonymous KindOf classes to
    use the new JavaClassKindOf. This cuts down on some of the noise
    produced by anonymous inner classes, especially given that these
    replacement points all had identical implementations.

    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Fix JRUBY-6766
    
    --profile slows down Array#join , which distorts profiling results
    
    This turned out to be a really good find.
    
    In order to avoid the cost of dispatching to methods like
    respond_to? and method_missing for value coercion, we pre-cache
    those methods in org.jruby.Ruby and use identity checks to
    shortcut faster, non-dynamic logic. This works well during normal
    execution, but under profiling all method objects are wrapped
    with ProfilingDynamicMethod objects that do the profile gathering.
    Because the identity of the original method then becomes obscured
    by the wrapper (which is created on a per-class basis) we always
    followed the slow path. The slow path in the case of
    method_missing raises an exception, and the exception backtraces
    were the source of profiling slowdown.
    
    I modified DelegatingDynamicMethod, the superclass of
    ProfilingDynamicMethod, to override equals() to consider only the
    wrapped method and fixed all related == comparisons to use
    equals(), ensuring that regardless of which wrapper was
    encountered the identity of the method would not be obscured. This
    returned profiled performance for e.g. Array#join to normal
    levels.
    
    I should note that this fix improves profiling performance for all
    coercion paths and methods that do coercion, so it has far-
    reaching implications.
    
    Thanks for reporting this :)

    Improve performance of RubyClass.getRealClass.
    
    getRealClass is used to traverse intermediate non-classes like
    included modules and singletons. Real classes (natural RubyClass
    instances) implement getRealClass to return this. Includes and
    singletons each separately implemented getRealClass to return
    superClass.getRealClass(), forcing all intermediates to be walked
    very time.
    
    Because getRealClass is used in a large number of places in JRuby,
    I have modified getRealClass to be a single final implementation
    that returns a new realClass field on RubyClass. This improves
    perf in two ways:
    
    1. It is no longer necessary to traverse superclasses to find the
    real class.
    
    2. Because there's only a single implementation, it should inline
    everywhere.

    Back each RubyString with persistent native memory when passing to a native function, as the transient memory backing (usually on the C stack) leads to confusion when it is reclaimed, and the native code was expecting it to be persistent.  This results in approx 150% (worst case) performance penalty for :string parameters, but its worth it to avoid differences between CRuby FFI and JRuby FFI.

    Prevent cache leakage in extreme method churn situations.
    
    While working on a support ticket, it came to my attention that Rails was
    generating lots of new methods for templates due to some gap in caching.
    These methods were generated with a new name each time, using the __id__
    of the Template object that would eventually manage them.
    
    Because our per-class caching did not actively flush (only passively,
    by invalidating each class and letting subsequent calls recache), old
    method names never encountered again would stick around in the cache.
    This led to a leak, as more and more new method names were created,
    called, and then abandoned.
    
    By actively invaldating the per-class cache in response to an invalidation
    event, we avoid the leak. It does not appear to add significant overhead
    to the invalidation process.

    Enable switchpoint call site invalidation and indirect call paths for invokedynamic support.
    
    SwitchPoint-based class hierarchy invalidation previously invalidated each in turn. This was
    known to be inefficient, since each invalidation forces the JVM to a safepoint in order to
    push invalidations out to code that has inlined through a SwitchPoint. I modified the
    invalidation logic to aggregate a collection of all SwitchPoints from child classes/modules
    and invalidate them as a batch.
    
    My benchmark was the time it takes to run the FFI specs. Because they run in rspec, and
    rspec redefines top-level methods for each example, ths SwitchPoint invalidation is hit hard.
    With the modified logic, the SP-based invalidation slows the suite to about 2x what it is
    without SP invalidation. This can still be improved, but it's good enough to enable SP
    invalidation for now.

    Move RString and RArray native handles to varTable.
    
    RString and RArray are cached in RubyString and RubyArray to avoid weak-caching
    handles or recreating handles frequently. However these fields add an additional
    32 or 64 bits to the size of all String and Array instances even when C exts are
    not in use. Since C ext use on JRuby is very uncommon, I've moved these fields
    into the lazily-allocated variable table, in the same manner as the rarely-used
    object_id. This reduces the size and allocation cost of all String and Array
    instances for the good of all JRubyists.
    
    The cost of retrieving the handles increases slightly due to hopping through
    getMetaClass.getRealClass, the accessor, and the array, but that cost likely
    pales in comparison to the already-high cost of C extensions, and only impacts
    Array and String instances that require native handles.

    Fix JRUBY-5483: become_java! only works on the first subclass of a deep class hierarchy
    Fix JRUBY-5491: jruby.reify.classes fails with optparse.rb (trinidad)
    
    The logic for when a class is reifiable was incorrect; it only allowed the first unreified chain of classes up to Object to reify; other children of reified classes would fail to reify and descendants of core classes other than Object or BasicObject were allowed to reify. The new logic allows only classes meeting the followign criteria to reify:
    
    * not already reified
    * reified parent must be Object, BasicObject, or Reified impl (new marker interface)
    * unreified parent must be reifiable
    
    This issue also caused JRUBY-5491 because classes that should be reified were not, resulting in them keeping the reifiable object allocator and recursing forever.

    Fix JRUBY-5221: jruby.reify.classes raising error with optparse
    
    The problem here was that the class in question (OptionParser::Switch) had a no-arg "pattern" method on both the object and the class. When generating reified Java methods, this caused an error, since it is not allowed to have both a static and an instance method with the same name and signature. I fixed it by giving priority to the instance method, since normally those will be the most important for reification (for interface impl, etc).
    
    * Prefer instance methods when name+signature conflicts with a static method
    * Move jitted code to rubyjit top-level package and reified classes to rubyobj top-level package
    * Add some debug logging to reify logic

    Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
    Date:   Wed Dec 1 09:41:29 2010 -0600
    
        Fix remaining failures for test-all.
    
        * Disable CheckClassAdapter temporarily, since it disallows what should be valid JVM identifiers.
        * Use the presence of $RUBY$ in method name as an additional indicator that we're processing a compiled Ruby body during backtrace gathering.
        * Move some largely-static properties out of "init" target in build.xml, so they're available whether init is triggered or not (e.g. run.jvm.model).

        Jitted specs running green.
    
        * eval needs to set method name into the binding, so it's there for "__method__" in the eval'ed code.

        Interpreted specs green on backtrace.
    
        * Tagged some __method__ specs for which backtrace behaves like 1.9, which Matz apparently likes but was afraid to backport. Odd cases anyway.
        * Fixed method name for the block used to define_method.

        More fixes to get specs and tests green on backtrace branch:
    
        * Hash#index was not being bound properly from RubyHash#index19
        * Range#min and Range#max need super, and therefore need frame = true
        * tc_owned is a bad test and fails on system like OS X where (for some reason) / may be owned by user
        * test_trace_func had been hacked for a bad class result (Integer, instead of Fixnum)...fixed that

    Fixes (and more) for JRUBY-4737: Compatibility issue with Spring property from 1.4.0 to 1.5.0.RC1
    
    It appears that JRuby 1.4.0 allowed various objects to coerce to "void" by returning null, so this commit fixes that.
    
    In addition, I've tried to unify some of the toJava logic, making most implementations call super.toJava if they can't coerce to the requested type (allowing RubyBasicObject's implementation to try some other avenues or error out). I also added some additional coersion cases for Time to java.util.Calendar, java.sql.Date/Time/TimeStamp, and joda's DateTime (it already did java.util.Date).

    Sweater unraveling for JRUBY-4615: java integration specs interference
    
    The original problem here was that depending on what order JI-related code was used, a different object could get cached for a java.lang.Class in ObjectProxyCache. Normally, it should just be the proxy wrapper, but some paths inserted a the RubyClass version of the class. This led to peculiar failures if specs were reordered.
    
    The fixes made here are as follows:
    
    * Eliminate all remaining to_java_object logic, which is where the bad OPC.put originated from
    * Move all coerce*ToJavaObject logic from JavaUtil into the appropriate toJava overrides

Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 20 21:43:01 2010 -0600

    New object_id implementation with uniqueness guarantees.
    
    Because identityHashCode turned out to be very unreliable as a unique ID, I redesigned object_id logic to use a strictly-increasing AtomicLong for both ObjectSpace and non-ObjectSpace modes. The long is stored into our object variable table, which is lazily allocated. This does mean that when object_id is called on a given object, the parent's variable table size increases. However, this size increase only affects other objects of the same type that also have object_id called on them (as you would expect) or which have other instance variables (in which case the size increase is just sizeof(pointer) for the extra slot). In general, this should not increase memory usage substantially except for objects that have had object_id called. No additional memory is used for objects that never have object_id called against them or same-typed objects. Also, because the new object_id is based on a Long * 2, object_id is guaranteed to be unique up to 2^63.

    First commit of new JI interface-impl code that actually generates a real Java class to use for the Ruby objects. Does not support concrete Java superclasses yet, which still goes through the old style logic.

commit 191a0dfdfef8c85a3aea32d44b14551d3d87ad22
Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 10 12:04:49 2009 -0600

    Fix for JRUBY-4271: interfaces on reified classes patch was incomplete and broke instances being passed to java code.
    
    The problem here was that interface implementing become_java!-fied classes still used the default toJava for Java integration, which ultimately returned just RubyObject or else errored out. Adding a toJava override that returns the actual Java class fixes the problem.
    
    No tests or specs for this, but there's none for become_java in general yet. Need to remedy that.

    Fix for JRUBY-3647: Severe performance degradation from 3d9140fafcda9c4fe6b9d5a1fec0ae9822877e03
    
    My lock-free approach to fixing JRUBY-3551 was clever, but introduced too much overhead into applications that do a lot of includes at runtime (usually in the form of obj.extend). So this falls back on the second-based fix, introducing a global hierarchy lock for when multiple threads concurrently tweak the hierarchy bits. Should still be as safe as before, only slightly slower for hierarchy modifications, and way faster for creating new classes or including modules.

    Move the cache-invalidation token to an Object equality check rather than an integer compare as recommended by John Rose; no loss of performance, only slightly more overhead during invalidation, and zero chance of a token collision.

    Add specific-arity paths for method_missing; in most cases args will get boxed again by *args, but this eliminates at least 2 levels of boxing for 1 and 2-arg calls and 1 level of boxing for 0 and N-arg calls.

    * Eliminate visibility checking for almost all fcall and vcall paths.
    * Outline some method_missing logic
    * Start adding some specific-arity paths for method_missing; still too much boxing, but the code isn't in normal call paths now.

    Add our first Java-land call site, for invoking initialize during object construction. Simple user object construction about 25% faster. Java object construction about 30% faster, now under 1s for 1M Integer.new. Looking to expand call site logic for general-purpose use (coercion calls, etc).

    The RC3 Surprise!
    
    Allow annotation defined ruby methods to optionally specify ThreadContext as first parameter
    Convert easiest and most common methods to accept ThreadContext when method or child method can use context
    
    These changes give about 15% improvement on petstore bench and about 10% in ar-bench.  In ar-bench getCurrentContext calls go from 14 million down to 2 million.  The remaining calls largely can be removed but they were much more invasive.
    
    IRubyObject op_eqq and op_equal both not have ThreadContext consumer, but we could see no use of this in any extensions and figured it worth the trouble of converting.

    - Identified and extracted construction paths for class/module/singleton/IncludedModuleWrapper, now there's no unnecessary null checks or assignments in their constructors (they take very few arguments so even asserts are not needed).
    Each of those constructors have a comment what is it the responsible for, also, two RubyClass.newClass() and two RubyModule.newModule() methods have been extracted.
    - Fixed logic that sets the parent/constant for Modules, now matches MRI (only setConstant/getConstantAt are used here).
    - RubyClass rewritten, special attention has been put on allocation logic, now Class.new(...) doesn't fire a separate allocator class. (btw, logic of "class B < A;end" and "Class.new(A)" must be split since in second case superclass and allocator are not known until initialize is called). Class/Object allocation implementation mimics MRI's weirdest quirks in behavior, is _much_ simpler that it has been and much faster. This also allowed creation of generalized clone/dup implementations matching MRI. (only our special ivars need a care here).
    - Rewritten bootstrapping of Object/Class/Module.
    - Core classes (except Exception hierarchy, they should also be in future) are now cached in runtime (MRI caches them in static VALUE's like rb_cObject) Ruby.getClass(String), Ruby.getModule(String) and Ruby.getClassFromPath(String) should be used only by either interpreter or compiler and when the class name is not known at compile time.
    - Fixed and simplified nodes: classNode, moduleNode, sclassNode, defsNode. Compiler has been synchronized here as well.
    - No more __attached__ as ivar, it is now MetaClass field (which means lazy ivars for singletons). Compiler also updated.
    - added and dosumented isModule() to IRubyObject (isClass(), isSintleton() documented).
    - Fixed test_autoload test (Object.class_eval do;autoload :SomeClass, 'somefile';class SomeClass; end;end) should raise LoadError, now matches MRI.
    
    - Fixed a number of minor bugs:
       1.instance_eval, was creating a metaclass for Fixnum instances (also affected Symbol/FalseClass/TrueClass/NilClass)
       marshaler objects were kept in singleton classes
       Range.inspect, was modifying the begin field (when it was a String)
       Many bulletproofings in Marshal/Unmarshal (like unmarshaling an instance of nonexistant class), TypeErrors/ArgumentErrors matching MRI.
       Fiber.new in 1.9, doesn't call #initialize method by funcall, fixed
       number of method arity fixes and many methods are made fast now
       fixed initialize/initialize_copy logic, further simplification, no ClassCastExceptions possible now
       Fixed defineClass(under)/defineModule(under) logic
       bulletproofed cases such: class A;end;module A;end

    Zero-sum (hopefully) refactoring of trace functions to have an "event hook" model more like MRI. ruby-debug (and likely jruby-debug in the future) makes use of this event hook mechanism, so we'll need to have it in place to make the port easy. Also in this commit, fixed JIT to actually be running (it got turned off accidentally sometime in the past week) and make sure it's using the same "safe" logic for def arguments.

    Fix the remaining marshalling issues (for JRUBY-531). Two different failures about singleton classes, first one because we didn't properly generate a singleton-name for cases where the enclosing class/module was singleton. The second problem is that ENV should really be a singleton, and can't be dumped. The real fix for ENV is to generate it the same way as ARGF, but that means custom implementation of a whole lot of hash-methods, which doesn't seem to tempting right now. The quick fix is to make sure ENV is actually a singleton object anyway, done by adding the to_s method as a singleton method to it.

    - Create a NULL_BLOCK to replace null checks against blocks:
      - Now isGiven() on a block tells you whether it is supplied or not
      - yield on the NULL_BLOCK throw the correct exception
        - We were not throwing this correctly by most callers with my landing of
          the block branch
        - We were generating NPE in cases where we called something that requires
          a block and supply none
    - Block.blockObject => Block.proc
     - Rename and type since this is just a convenience reference for association
       from block to what proc it might represent
    - Remove unused blockAtCreation (this may become relevent for Ruby 2 but why do
      it now
    - Remove ThreadContext and IRuby from Frame
    - Remove Scope
    - Put Visibility directly on Frame
    - callingzsuper dead code
    - Now that modules have a proper superclass we can get rid of special code in
      callSuper
    - ArgsPushNode.childNodes should not return null

    Big set of changes for marshalling bug JRUBY-472; getting closer to having things sorted out. One known failure in "ant
    test" is due to our modules defining methods on a singleton class, which appears to be incorrect and harder to fix. I'm
    on it though.

    My Laptop drive is sounding funny (dropping a little earlier than normal -- but completely safe)
    ReflectionCallback is simpler - removed some indirection levels and split out new dispatch mechanism as...
    new ReflectedMethod which has less levels of indirection than reflectioncallback and will replace it entriely once all builtin classes use MetaClasses.
    Many protocol conversion protocols are being followed.  Almost all in numerical methods and a few in array, pack.
    Several classes have been changed to have a FooMetaClass.
    'ant test' is running between 25-20% faster right now and this should increase as I convert more builtin classes
