    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

commit 330fef3b0fc18af477ccea19bd278669667f31bb
Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 12 14:49:29 2013 -0600

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Mostly fix JRUBY-6760: ArgumentError output
    
    It's not possible right now for us to have ArgumentError report
    the file:line of the called method, since arity checking occurs
    outside the method body. However, we usually do have the called
    name available at that point, so we can include it in the error
    message.

    Restore double-init to nil for Struct fields.
    
    * Init in constructor is defensive, to ensure there's no nulls
    * Init in initialize is necessary for pathological cases that set values in child class initialize and then call super with fewer values. See rubyspec/core/struct/initialize_spec.rb for "explicitly sets instance variables".

        Get 1.8 specs running green except for a handful of Kernel#caller specs (which don't expect to see .java files in the trace...not sure how to deal with that).
    
        * Fix another literal-block-calling path that wasn't using callIter

        Remaining fixes to get precompiled mode passing all our tests. Still some spec failures.
    
        * Bump up permgen max for test runs
        * Fix stack-based scope initialization to not leave an unused nil on stack
        * Ensure compiled method handles properly wrap pre/post logic for dummy and backtrace frames.

    Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
    Date:   Mon Oct 11 18:36:34 2010 -0500
    
        First fixes for backtrace branch in precompiled mode:
    
        * Add test-precompiled build target for running just precompiled
        * Eliminate extraneous toplevel scope being pushed for precompiled loads (because that logic is all in the generated "load" method now.
        * Add a new scope descriptor decoding path that properly sets up a toplevel scope

        Fixes to get specs a bit closer to running green.
    
        * Move pre/post logic for Script.load into generated code, so it's the same everywhere.
        * Make pre/post-load push a frame, so top-level of a script is always framed
        * Remove break handling from non-literal block call paths in CachingCallSite
        * Make sure all literal block calls are using CallSite.callIter, which handles break
        * Fix a bad test in testCompiler that needed visibility tweaks and framing
        * Add complete doco for CallSite
        * Fix Kernel#caller to trim from top of stack instead of bottom

        Performance changes for backtrace logic:
    
        * Back off using Java stack trace for Proc's to_s file+line, since it's prohibitively expensive
        * Move the Backtrace stack to being a fixed-size array of objects updated, rather than created, when a push happens

    First commit of new JI interface-impl code that actually generates a real Java class to use for the Ruby objects. Does not support concrete Java superclasses yet, which still goes through the old style logic.

    Large refactoring of CallConfiguration and compiler logic pertaining to it:
    
    * Made CallConfiguration an enum, aggregating new Framing and Scoping enums
    * Juggled all references to CallConfiguration to be appropriate for its new enum status
    * Reduced and simplified logic based on CallConfiguration in compiler
    * Added remaining permutations of framing and scoping to better support proper execution in frameless mode. With these changes MRI's test.rb runs green in "fastest" mode.

    Big changes, remove 4 fields from RubyBasicObject (finalizer, dataStruct, variableTableSize, variableTableThreshold) Replace variableTable by variables (external org.jruby.runtime.builtin.InstanceVariableTable). The new structure supports packed mode (for <= 5 instance variable when it does linear search for lookup). Finalizer and dataStruct are now kept as internal instance variables. Need to review concurrency issues.

    The RC3 Surprise!
    
    Allow annotation defined ruby methods to optionally specify ThreadContext as first parameter
    Convert easiest and most common methods to accept ThreadContext when method or child method can use context
    
    These changes give about 15% improvement on petstore bench and about 10% in ar-bench.  In ar-bench getCurrentContext calls go from 14 million down to 2 million.  The remaining calls largely can be removed but they were much more invasive.
    
    IRubyObject op_eqq and op_equal both not have ThreadContext consumer, but we could see no use of this in any extensions and figured it worth the trouble of converting.

    Remove "intern by default" from many call paths and explicitly intern only when the result will be passed to a method that requires interned strings. This should help reduce the amount of interning going on, easing some permgen pressure. The ultimate and best fix would be to forego interned strings in favor of an artificial ID.

    Concurrent SymbolTable implementation. About 5% faster (in bench_symbol) than the ST code introduced in 4580 (which is mostly reverted here), and now threadsafe.
    
    As with the concurrent vars code, should perform especially well in multi-threaded applications.
    
    For interpreted mode, caches the symbol at the SymbolNode (almost identical to Fixnum handling).
    
    Still _much_ slower than MRI in bench_symbol (unlike vars/constants, where we're faster now).  Could be much faster if we cached the Symbol in compiled code.

commit 3e88cfab0d224fb9efa8d18336993e2c78ce495e

    - Identified and extracted construction paths for class/module/singleton/IncludedModuleWrapper, now there's no unnecessary null checks or assignments in their constructors (they take very few arguments so even asserts are not needed).
    Each of those constructors have a comment what is it the responsible for, also, two RubyClass.newClass() and two RubyModule.newModule() methods have been extracted.
    - Fixed logic that sets the parent/constant for Modules, now matches MRI (only setConstant/getConstantAt are used here).
    - RubyClass rewritten, special attention has been put on allocation logic, now Class.new(...) doesn't fire a separate allocator class. (btw, logic of "class B < A;end" and "Class.new(A)" must be split since in second case superclass and allocator are not known until initialize is called). Class/Object allocation implementation mimics MRI's weirdest quirks in behavior, is _much_ simpler that it has been and much faster. This also allowed creation of generalized clone/dup implementations matching MRI. (only our special ivars need a care here).
    - Rewritten bootstrapping of Object/Class/Module.
    - Core classes (except Exception hierarchy, they should also be in future) are now cached in runtime (MRI caches them in static VALUE's like rb_cObject) Ruby.getClass(String), Ruby.getModule(String) and Ruby.getClassFromPath(String) should be used only by either interpreter or compiler and when the class name is not known at compile time.
    - Fixed and simplified nodes: classNode, moduleNode, sclassNode, defsNode. Compiler has been synchronized here as well.
    - No more __attached__ as ivar, it is now MetaClass field (which means lazy ivars for singletons). Compiler also updated.
    - added and dosumented isModule() to IRubyObject (isClass(), isSintleton() documented).
    - Fixed test_autoload test (Object.class_eval do;autoload :SomeClass, 'somefile';class SomeClass; end;end) should raise LoadError, now matches MRI.
    
    - Fixed a number of minor bugs:
       1.instance_eval, was creating a metaclass for Fixnum instances (also affected Symbol/FalseClass/TrueClass/NilClass)
       marshaler objects were kept in singleton classes
       Range.inspect, was modifying the begin field (when it was a String)
       Many bulletproofings in Marshal/Unmarshal (like unmarshaling an instance of nonexistant class), TypeErrors/ArgumentErrors matching MRI.
       Fiber.new in 1.9, doesn't call #initialize method by funcall, fixed
       number of method arity fixes and many methods are made fast now
       fixed initialize/initialize_copy logic, further simplification, no ClassCastExceptions possible now
       Fixed defineClass(under)/defineModule(under) logic
       bulletproofed cases such: class A;end;module A;end

    Fix the remaining marshalling issues (for JRUBY-531). Two different failures about singleton classes, first one because we didn't properly generate a singleton-name for cases where the enclosing class/module was singleton. The second problem is that ENV should really be a singleton, and can't be dumped. The real fix for ENV is to generate it the same way as ARGF, but that means custom implementation of a whole lot of hash-methods, which doesn't seem to tempting right now. The quick fix is to make sure ENV is actually a singleton object anyway, done by adding the to_s method as a singleton method to it.

    - Create a NULL_BLOCK to replace null checks against blocks:
      - Now isGiven() on a block tells you whether it is supplied or not
      - yield on the NULL_BLOCK throw the correct exception
        - We were not throwing this correctly by most callers with my landing of
          the block branch
        - We were generating NPE in cases where we called something that requires
          a block and supply none
    - Block.blockObject => Block.proc
     - Rename and type since this is just a convenience reference for association
       from block to what proc it might represent
    - Remove unused blockAtCreation (this may become relevent for Ruby 2 but why do
      it now
    - Remove ThreadContext and IRuby from Frame
    - Remove Scope
    - Put Visibility directly on Frame
    - callingzsuper dead code
    - Now that modules have a proper superclass we can get rid of special code in
      callSuper
    - ArgsPushNode.childNodes should not return null

    Kill RubyClasses (core class/modules now initialized in Ruby)

    Convenience function RubyModule#getClass added
    Convenience function Ruby#getObject added
    JavaObject and JavaArray are now Java::JavaObject and Java::JavaArray to be consistent
    classes defined under another class/module are now defined in the parents creation routine
    Removed some masking warnings
