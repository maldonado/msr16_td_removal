    Final modifications to get scopes loading from cache.
    
    * For initial Script execution via __file__, must setRootScope
    * Script.load impl will setRootScope
    * All other method forms will receive scope index from parent compiler

    Merge "backtrace" branch to master, now that it runs clean on all our various test cases.
    
    This is a squashed merge encompassing the following commits from "backtrace":

    commit 32137decc9351dd7b6a19c49c7955808f535bb9c
    Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
    Date:   Wed Dec 1 09:41:29 2010 -0600
    
        Fix remaining failures for test-all.
    
        * Disable CheckClassAdapter temporarily, since it disallows what should be valid JVM identifiers.
        * Use the presence of $RUBY$ in method name as an additional indicator that we're processing a compiled Ruby body during backtrace gathering.
        * Move some largely-static properties out of "init" target in build.xml, so they're available whether init is triggered or not (e.g. run.jvm.model).

        Precompiled (AOT) specs *nearly* green.
    
        * Mark __method__ as reading frame "name"
        * Fix AOT-based stack trace mining logic

        Jitted specs running green.
    
        * eval needs to set method name into the binding, so it's there for "__method__" in the eval'ed code.
    
    commit fd442c0a815bcab9eb6c9aa1b71e1f8a260ee03b
    Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
    Date:   Mon Nov 29 16:06:53 2010 -0600
    
        Interpreted specs green on backtrace.
    
        * Tagged some __method__ specs for which backtrace behaves like 1.9, which Matz apparently likes but was afraid to backport. Odd cases anyway.
        * Fixed method name for the block used to define_method.
    
    commit cedb27e430b422c1158f66b4dcc7769922433506

        More fixes to get specs and tests green on backtrace branch:
    
        * Hash#index was not being bound properly from RubyHash#index19
        * Range#min and Range#max need super, and therefore need frame = true
        * tc_owned is a bad test and fails on system like OS X where (for some reason) / may be owned by user
        * test_trace_func had been hacked for a bad class result (Integer, instead of Fixnum)...fixed that

        First fixes for backtrace branch in precompiled mode:
    
        * Add test-precompiled build target for running just precompiled
        * Eliminate extraneous toplevel scope being pushed for precompiled loads (because that logic is all in the generated "load" method now.
        * Add a new scope descriptor decoding path that properly sets up a toplevel scope

        Performance changes for backtrace logic:
    
        * Back off using Java stack trace for Proc's to_s file+line, since it's prohibitively expensive
        * Move the Backtrace stack to being a fixed-size array of objects updated, rather than created, when a push happens

        Full speed ahead with a caching mechanism for calls from core classes. Only works for core class methods right now, but opens the door to expanding that.

        Fixes to get run-junit-compiled 100% passing on backtrace branch.
    
        * Fixed a couple tests that are too sensitive to core method line numbers or expected only .rb elements in the trace
        * Added a mechanism for procs to retrieve the most recent Ruby frame, for to_s purposes
        * Added comments for hybrid backtrace logic

        Add better logging to AnnotationBinder (for showing framed/scoped core methods), ASTInspector (for showing methods detected as framed/scoped and for reporting deopt flags as they are set), and JITCompiler (for dumping jitted methods' full classes and inspector results). New property jruby.jit.dumping=(true|FALSE).

        Fixes for jitted/compiled backtrace generation
    
        * SClass in a method body needs to frame, so it has a jump target for non-local return
        * Compiled methods need to always have their ruby name in the method name, so it can be mined out appropriately
        * Synthetic calls, like to rescue bodies, need to gobble caller frames to avoid multiple entries

    Refactor compiler to produce all static methods, with the AbstractScript subclass as the first argument. Will make the next phase of the compiler easier, since we can pull out script logic from compiled classes. Seems to speed things up slightly too.

    Another round of compiled block optimizations:
    * Use RubyArray's fillNil (now moved to RuntimeHelpers) instead of Arrays.fill
    * Nuke BoxedVariableCompiler, since with proc-as-binding it will never work (and hasn't been kept up-to-date anyway)
    * Add "expression" param to local var lookup methods, to specify whether they should leave a value on stack. First step toward fully expression-aware compilation.
    * Only handle exception-based redo when body contains nested logic that could cause it (scope-aware methods like eval).
    * Reduce preamble logic for both methods and closures by reducing unnecessary stack-twiddling.

    Wide-ranging rework of exception-handling synthetic methods:

    * outline method moved to Root and Child method compiler base types
    * Simple ensures modified to use new outline logic
    * Rescues modified to use new outline logic for both main logic and bodies; no sharing yet between ruby and java exception paths
    * Small reduction of code generated for rescues
    * Simplification of rescue logic in compiler, due to outline use

    * AbstractMethodCompiler becomes BaseBodyCompiler
    * ASMMethodCompiler split into a subhierarchy of "root-scoped" body compilers
    * ASMClosureCompiler becomes "child-scoped" body compiler
    
    All preparations for making per-type compilation behaviors more customized, especially to help move towards method bodies using a direct reference to their static scope for constant lookup.
