    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Start moving away from dependence on JavaArray objects.
    
    All Java arrays that are proxied into Ruby get wrapped with an
    ArrayJavaProxy instance. However, the paths to create that wrapper
    usually involve constructing an intermedate JavaArray wrapper as
    well, slowing down allocation. This change makes the following
    changes to Java array proxies:
    
    * ArrayJavaProxy and subclasses are no longer allocatable.
    
    * All paths that created array proxies indirectly now create
    ArrayJavaProxy instances directly, avoiding the intermediate
    JavArray object
    
    * The JavaArray wrapper is created lazily only when needed.
    
    Additional fixes are coming that will do more to avoid standing up
    the JavaArray object.

    Fix inspect output for non-imported classes.
    
    In the JRuby Java integration subsystem, imported classes get
    assigned a base name (the class's "simple name") and a containing
    module (the package module) which allows them to use default
    inspect logic. However, classes returned that are never imported
    do not get a base name or containing module set, and inspect as
    anonymous classes (i.e. useless). This patch modifies Java proxy
    building to set the base name and parent module for all Java
    class proxies at setup time.

    Workaround for JRUBY-6967
    
    Equals operator is not symmetrical and throws exceptions for Java classes
    
    When we bind methods for a given class, we first search to see
    whether the same method is defined in a superclass. If it is, we
    consider that method to not have a "local" definition, and so we
    don't define it.
    
    In addition, the aliasing for == only happens at the highest
    levels of the hierarchy, so overridden Java equals methods never
    bind a new == because they're never local (except on j.l.Object)
    and we don't assign aliases if there's no local impl of the method
    in question.
    
    This workaround fixes the issue by always forcing equals to be
    considered "local" and forcibly adding a "==" alias to it. Any
    class that defines its own equals method will now also have "=="
    pointing at it, avoiding the Comparable#== that triggered this
    issue.
    
    There still needs to be a reexamination of how we bind methods.
    The "local" search was intended to find a superclass method in
    cases where the subclass may be private, breaking dispatch against
    its direct reflected method. However, it causes the troubling
    side effect from this bug, where mixed-in modules will override
    the superclass methods (like "==") with no way for the subclass
    to define their own versions if simply overriding.

    Fix Scala singleton support.
    
    Scala singletons were being walked for their companion methods, but
    because we only add methods that are "local" under normal
    circumstances (local meaning on that class or on an interface) we
    never actually installed them. Modified the installer to always
    install Scala singleton methods and added/reworked specs to do the
    right thing.

    Fix for JRUBY-4799: Uncaught AccessibleObject.setAccessible fails on App Engine
    
    The fix here is to avoid binding any methods from non-public classes, since from Java's perspective they're not callable that way. Instead, it only uses parent class methods and implemented interface methods. This does cause a behavioral change: non-public classes will appear to have no methods now, since the setAccessible we used to do is not always possible.

    Remove __method methods, since their functionality can be achieved (better) through the new java_ methods.

    Only bind child classes' instance methods if they add something (more visibility, more overloads) to what the parent classes provide. Reduces bound methods in proxy classes substantially.

    Eliminate some and reduce other setAccessible calls for JRUBY-4246.
    
    * For all methods in all classes encountered by JRuby, we were doing setAccessible one at a time. This meant that even if the class was never directly used (and lazily initialized) we still called setAccessible for all methods. For classes that were directly used, we ended up doing a second round of setAccessible calls for each named group of methods. The latter remains, but is now the only setAccessible for methods and constructors.
    * All fields were being setAccessible. In the case of static public final fields, which we create constants for, this was obviously unnecessary. In the case of regular fields, we only ever retrieved the list of public fields, so it was again unnecessary. Also note that in both cases we did the setAccessible calls eagerly.

    Final phase of removing the middle man object from argument coercion, pulling the early and late coercion logic together into a single pass. Other than improving the actual coercion and method-selection logic, it's now about as straight-through as it will get.

    Fix for JRUBY-2093 and JRUBY-2270: eliminated the per-method matchingMethod cache used by InstanceMethodInvoker (and *not* used by StaticMethodInvoker), as it didn't take into account arity and would therefore sometimes return the wrong method (JRUBY-2093), was a pain to synchronize (JRUBY-2270), and added overhead while providing no benefit in the common case where there are not multiple methods with the same name and arity.  Also reworked synchronization so that only a relatively inexpensive volatile read is required for all but the first invocation of a method of a given name.
    
    Also includes a small tweak to primitive class matching to evaluate more probable (by my guesstimation) candidates first.

    The RC3 Surprise!
    
    Allow annotation defined ruby methods to optionally specify ThreadContext as first parameter
    Convert easiest and most common methods to accept ThreadContext when method or child method can use context
    
    These changes give about 15% improvement on petstore bench and about 10% in ar-bench.  In ar-bench getCurrentContext calls go from 14 million down to 2 million.  The remaining calls largely can be removed but they were much more invasive.
    
    IRubyObject op_eqq and op_equal both not have ThreadContext consumer, but we could see no use of this in any extensions and figured it worth the trouble of converting.

    Fix for JRUBY-2069.  Problems with equals() and hashCode() methods caused every instantiation of a Ruby-defined Java subclass to add a new entry to the method match cache (in the same bucket!), since returned hashCode was that of the class, new constructors were returned on every call, and equals() would never return true.  So if you created 1000 instances, then 1000 entries were searched for the 1001st instantiation, and so on.
    
    Fixed equals/hashCode for other types as well, should improve method-matching speed in general.  (The new versions no longer call out to the Ruby hash and == methods; these are internal classes, after all.) I still plan to rework matching_method, as there are other issues.

    Remove "intern by default" from many call paths and explicitly intern only when the result will be passed to a method that requires interned strings. This should help reduce the amount of interning going on, easing some permgen pressure. The ultimate and best fix would be to forego interned strings in favor of an artificial ID.

Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 26 22:49:04 2007 +0000

    Offload instance variable methods to a separate interface to reduce the implementation load for IRubyObject. This also is another step toward making lightweights possible; by separating the ivar logic from the object logic (visibly, anyway) it means we can externally represent that logic for lightweights more easily. Bill pointed out that his larger IRubyObject/Object/lightweight refactoring used a similar decomposition, so this has at least been proven out in one form.

    Remove the three generic type conversion methods from RubyObject/IRubyObject to TypeConverter utility class. They were never overridden, and so there's no need for them to live in the IRubyObject/RubyObject hierarchy.

    Eliminate two callMethod versions from IRubyObject, in favor of a few RuntimeHelpers.invoke* variants that go straight to invoke methods on the metaclass. This helps move invocation logic out of (I)RubyObject to reduce the implementation load. More to come.

commit 3e88cfab0d224fb9efa8d18336993e2c78ce495e
Author: Marcin Mielżyński <lopx@gazeta.pl>
Date:   Thu Sep 27 16:40:57 2007 +0000

    - Identified and extracted construction paths for class/module/singleton/IncludedModuleWrapper, now there's no unnecessary null checks or assignments in their constructors (they take very few arguments so even asserts are not needed).
    Each of those constructors have a comment what is it the responsible for, also, two RubyClass.newClass() and two RubyModule.newModule() methods have been extracted.
    - Fixed logic that sets the parent/constant for Modules, now matches MRI (only setConstant/getConstantAt are used here).
    - RubyClass rewritten, special attention has been put on allocation logic, now Class.new(...) doesn't fire a separate allocator class. (btw, logic of "class B < A;end" and "Class.new(A)" must be split since in second case superclass and allocator are not known until initialize is called). Class/Object allocation implementation mimics MRI's weirdest quirks in behavior, is _much_ simpler that it has been and much faster. This also allowed creation of generalized clone/dup implementations matching MRI. (only our special ivars need a care here).
    - Rewritten bootstrapping of Object/Class/Module.
    - Core classes (except Exception hierarchy, they should also be in future) are now cached in runtime (MRI caches them in static VALUE's like rb_cObject) Ruby.getClass(String), Ruby.getModule(String) and Ruby.getClassFromPath(String) should be used only by either interpreter or compiler and when the class name is not known at compile time.
    - Fixed and simplified nodes: classNode, moduleNode, sclassNode, defsNode. Compiler has been synchronized here as well.
    - No more __attached__ as ivar, it is now MetaClass field (which means lazy ivars for singletons). Compiler also updated.
    - added and dosumented isModule() to IRubyObject (isClass(), isSintleton() documented).
    - Fixed test_autoload test (Object.class_eval do;autoload :SomeClass, 'somefile';class SomeClass; end;end) should raise LoadError, now matches MRI.
    
    - Fixed a number of minor bugs:
       1.instance_eval, was creating a metaclass for Fixnum instances (also affected Symbol/FalseClass/TrueClass/NilClass)
       marshaler objects were kept in singleton classes
       Range.inspect, was modifying the begin field (when it was a String)
       Many bulletproofings in Marshal/Unmarshal (like unmarshaling an instance of nonexistant class), TypeErrors/ArgumentErrors matching MRI.
       Fiber.new in 1.9, doesn't call #initialize method by funcall, fixed
       number of method arity fixes and many methods are made fast now
       fixed initialize/initialize_copy logic, further simplification, no ClassCastExceptions possible now
       Fixed defineClass(under)/defineModule(under) logic
       bulletproofed cases such: class A;end;module A;end

commit 1dbbe1a37a3d9cd926b906dc06b5a8578de6b3b3
Author: Bill Dortch <bill.dortch@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Sep 21 03:25:29 2007 +0000

    More JI cleanup:
     - Reworked the very expensive and thread-unsafe (and essentially obsolete) proxy extender mechanism. No longer is every new proxy checked against all proxy extenders; since the Rubification of the Java class hierarchy, it's really only necessary to extend the class/module specified in the extend_proxy method. I'd like to see this feature deprecated, as it's redundant now (see forthcoming note on jruby-dev).
     - Moved JavaClass instances to a ConcurrentHashMap for faster access.  They had been in a weak hash map, but since almost all of them were linked to proxies that were in non-weak maps, there was really no benefit (and some performance penalties).
     - Used concurrent techniques to speed proxy class lookup.  Proxies are now stored with their corresponding JavaClass instances, and can be retrieved with an unsynchronized access.
     - Eliminated the ProxyData "dataStruct" that had been attached to the JavaUtilities module; most of the fields (maps) had been eliminated in the work noted above; the remaining fields have been moved to JavaSupport where they may be accessed without a JavaUtilities reference.
     - Permanently disabled the the old-style (<) interface implementation syntax (there had been a method to enable it; no more).
     - Fixed a bug wherein the colon2 syntax for opening modules was not working if the module had not previously been referenced.  Will open a JIRA and backport to the 1.0 branch.
    
    Fixes JRUBY-931 (thread-unsafe proxy extender access).
    
    Most of this work is transitional; i.e., will probably be implemented differently when JI is overhauled.  Just cleaning up and clearing away dead wood in advance of that overhaul.

    - Create a NULL_BLOCK to replace null checks against blocks:
      - Now isGiven() on a block tells you whether it is supplied or not
      - yield on the NULL_BLOCK throw the correct exception
        - We were not throwing this correctly by most callers with my landing of
          the block branch
        - We were generating NPE in cases where we called something that requires
          a block and supply none
    - Block.blockObject => Block.proc
     - Rename and type since this is just a convenience reference for association
       from block to what proc it might represent
    - Remove unused blockAtCreation (this may become relevent for Ruby 2 but why do
      it now
    - Remove ThreadContext and IRuby from Frame
    - Remove Scope
    - Put Visibility directly on Frame
    - callingzsuper dead code
    - Now that modules have a proper superclass we can get rid of special code in
      callSuper
    - ArgsPushNode.childNodes should not return null

    Big set of changes for marshalling bug JRUBY-472; getting closer to having things sorted out. One known failure in "ant
    test" is due to our modules defining methods on a singleton class, which appears to be incorrect and harder to fix. I'm
    on it though.

    Backing out lazy proxy instance method creation (alias and respond_to? problems)
    Refactor original javasupport.rb:
    - Remove as many extra java_class variables as possible to reduce confusion
    - Adding methods, variables, and constants to proxy class all basically add these using the same technique.  We used to use several different ways.  This should make things a little easier to read
    - Define high-level conversion methods Java.ruby_to_java and Java.java_to_ruby.  These are like primitive_to_java (and its couterpart), but they additionally wrap the result or grab the java_object.  These were mainly added to aid readability.  Next point release we will refactor all conversion methods to some formalized set
    - Change semantics of Java::JavaClass#get_fields and Java::JavaClass#get_declared_fields to return the fields and not the names of the fields.  Javasupport prefers the fields and semantically this seems the path of least surprises
    - Add in old optimization to curry method of instance and class methods when only one Java method of a particular name exists.
