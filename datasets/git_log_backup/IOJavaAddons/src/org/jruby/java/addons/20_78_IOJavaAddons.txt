    Apparently my refactoring fu is weak. Removing more TC.getRuntime.

    Fix JRUBY-5514: Errno::EBADF is sometimes raised instead of IOError when TCPSocket#readline is called after TCPSocket#close
    
    The problem here is that under real concurrency, EBADF or equivalent are perfectly valid to see. Eventually you have to make a low-level IO call, and under concurrent load that could happen just slightly after another thread calls #close. There's little we can do to eliminate EBADF, but I have cleaned up some paths that raised it unnecessarily and others that raised EPIPE when they should not.
    
    I also cleaned up several places that could cause a NullPointerException when under concurrent load, because a stream gets nulled out after it has already been checked for non-nullness.

    Merge "backtrace" branch to master, now that it runs clean on all our various test cases.
    
    This is a squashed merge encompassing the following commits from "backtrace":

    commit 32137decc9351dd7b6a19c49c7955808f535bb9c
    Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
    Date:   Wed Dec 1 09:41:29 2010 -0600
    
        Fix remaining failures for test-all.
    
        * Disable CheckClassAdapter temporarily, since it disallows what should be valid JVM identifiers.
        * Use the presence of $RUBY$ in method name as an additional indicator that we're processing a compiled Ruby body during backtrace gathering.
        * Move some largely-static properties out of "init" target in build.xml, so they're available whether init is triggered or not (e.g. run.jvm.model).

        * eval needs to set method name into the binding, so it's there for "__method__" in the eval'ed code.

    Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
    Date:   Mon Nov 29 16:06:53 2010 -0600
    
        Interpreted specs green on backtrace.
    
        * Tagged some __method__ specs for which backtrace behaves like 1.9, which Matz apparently likes but was afraid to backport. Odd cases anyway.
        * Fixed method name for the block used to define_method.

        More fixes to get specs and tests green on backtrace branch:
    
        * Hash#index was not being bound properly from RubyHash#index19
        * Range#min and Range#max need super, and therefore need frame = true
        * tc_owned is a bad test and fails on system like OS X where (for some reason) / may be owned by user
        * test_trace_func had been hacked for a bad class result (Integer, instead of Fixnum)...fixed that

        * Eliminate extraneous toplevel scope being pushed for precompiled loads (because that logic is all in the generated "load" method now.
        * Add a new scope descriptor decoding path that properly sets up a toplevel scope

        Performance changes for backtrace logic:
    
        * Back off using Java stack trace for Proc's to_s file+line, since it's prohibitively expensive
        * Move the Backtrace stack to being a fixed-size array of objects updated, rather than created, when a push happens

        Full speed ahead with a caching mechanism for calls from core classes. Only works for core class methods right now, but opens the door to expanding that.

        Fixes to get run-junit-compiled 100% passing on backtrace branch.
    
        * Fixed a couple tests that are too sensitive to core method line numbers or expected only .rb elements in the trace
        * Added a mechanism for procs to retrieve the most recent Ruby frame, for to_s purposes
        * Added comments for hybrid backtrace logic

        Add better logging to AnnotationBinder (for showing framed/scoped core methods), ASTInspector (for showing methods detected as framed/scoped and for reporting deopt flags as they are set), and JITCompiler (for dumping jitted methods' full classes and inspector results). New property jruby.jit.dumping=(true|FALSE).

        Fixes for jitted/compiled backtrace generation
    
        * SClass in a method body needs to frame, so it has a jump target for non-local return
        * Compiled methods need to always have their ruby name in the method name, so it can be mined out appropriately
        * Synthetic calls, like to rescue bodies, need to gobble caller frames to avoid multiple entries
