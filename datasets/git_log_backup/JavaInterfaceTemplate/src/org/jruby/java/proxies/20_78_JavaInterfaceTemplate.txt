    Mostly fix JRUBY-6760: ArgumentError output
    
    It's not possible right now for us to have ArgumentError report
    the file:line of the called method, since arity checking occurs
    outside the method body. However, we usually do have the called
    name available at that point, so we can include it in the error
    message.

    Fix JRUBY-5317.
    
    Objects loaded via Marshal don't get Java class applied corrected unless passed through fn taking exact type
    
    The problem here was that Marshal uses allocate to create objects
    coming in, but all our logic for initializing JI-related subclasses
    lived in "new". By moving that logic to allocate we clean up both
    the "new" stuff (no need for custom method anymore) and also ensure
    the logic runs regardless of whether you "new" or "allocate" the
    object.
    
    I have run our tests, but it would be helpful to get more cases
    surrounding Marshal and have user codebases run with this patch
    in place.

        Fix remaining failures for test-all.
    
        * Disable CheckClassAdapter temporarily, since it disallows what should be valid JVM identifiers.
        * Use the presence of $RUBY$ in method name as an additional indicator that we're processing a compiled Ruby body during backtrace gathering.
        * Move some largely-static properties out of "init" target in build.xml, so they're available whether init is triggered or not (e.g. run.jvm.model).

        * Fixed method name for the block used to define_method.

        * Hash#index was not being bound properly from RubyHash#index19
        * Range#min and Range#max need super, and therefore need frame = true
        * tc_owned is a bad test and fails on system like OS X where (for some reason) / may be owned by user
        * test_trace_func had been hacked for a bad class result (Integer, instead of Fixnum)...fixed that

        * Eliminate extraneous toplevel scope being pushed for precompiled loads (because that logic is all in the generated "load" method now.
        * Add a new scope descriptor decoding path that properly sets up a toplevel scope

        * Fix Kernel#caller to trim from top of stack instead of bottom

        Fixes to get test-compiled (but not precompiled) passing 100%.
    
        * Fix eqlInternal's RubyNumeric branch check if classes are equal
        * Provide file and line from all BlockBodies, so Proc#to_s can always use it
        * Fix rejiggered Struct#each and Struct#each_pair to call the appropriate internal version
        * Fix ruby_test's IO.new suite to not use STDOUT directly, risking that it get closed

        Performance changes for backtrace logic:
    
        * Back off using Java stack trace for Proc's to_s file+line, since it's prohibitively expensive
        * Move the Backtrace stack to being a fixed-size array of objects updated, rather than created, when a push happens

        Add better logging to AnnotationBinder (for showing framed/scoped core methods), ASTInspector (for showing methods detected as framed/scoped and for reporting deopt flags as they are set), and JITCompiler (for dumping jitted methods' full classes and inspector results).

        Fixes for jitted/compiled backtrace generation
    
        * SClass in a method body needs to frame, so it has a jump target for non-local return
        * Compiled methods need to always have their ruby name in the method name, so it can be mined out appropriately
        * Synthetic calls, like to rescue bodies, need to gobble caller frames to avoid multiple entries

    Large refactoring of JavaMethod subtypes to fill out all permutations and try to guarantee no more than a single hop through generic code to unique code for almost all paths.

    Fix for JRUBY-3161: java interface in base class cannot implement in derived class
    
    The fix here is simply to have the eventual interface impl logic walk all superclasses looking for @java_interfaces, aggregating them all together.

    Fix for JRUBY-2959. No tests yet; need to isolate why some interfaces have this effect and some do not.

    Miscellaneous call optimizations:
    * Partial arity-splitting of super invocation (really only useful for Java to Ruby calls
    * Moved callSuper logic into RuntimeHelpers, modified all callers to use the new methods, and deprecated callSuper on IRubyObject
    * Eliminated 30-some more uses of indexed IRubyObject.callMethod and deprecated one of them
