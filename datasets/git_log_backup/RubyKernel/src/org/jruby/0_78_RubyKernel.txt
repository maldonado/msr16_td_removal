    Reintroduce native Delegator extension to speed delegated calls.
    
    This native implementation does method_missing all in Java code,
    which provides the following benefits:
    
    * No requirement for a frame or scope in method_missing logic,
      as with the pure-Ruby version.
    * Direct lookup and dispatch to target method, rather than through
      __send__ logic.
    * Only respond_to? check if method is not naturally defined, to
      catch respond_to_missing? and similar cases.
    * Directly omit lines from backtrace rather than manually
      manipulating it (which did not always work due to our different
      formatting for backtraces that bubble all the way out).
    
    This new version is nearly 2x faster than the pure-Ruby version.

    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

commit 330fef3b0fc18af477ccea19bd278669667f31bb
Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 12 14:49:29 2013 -0600

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    I believe we were trying to coerce the hash args to String, which
    failed...and then the failure was swallowed due to another bug
    (already filed). This commit does not add options support, but
    does trim them off the end of the args array and warns (once) that
    they will be ignored. We plan to get the remaining process options
    working in 1.7.1, and there are numerous other bugs for that.

    Fix JRUBY-6832
    
    self is wrong in set_trace_func when raising NoMethodErrors
    
    The default method_missing implementations still were being
    framed, since they used to need that to get the name of the method
    being called. However, at some point they just started to use the
    name being passed through the call chain, which meant the frame
    was unnecessary. The bug was caused by the fact that the binding's
    self also comes from the frame, which in method_missing would be
    the object against which the missing method was being called. That
    caused both "self" and "s" in the bug report to point at the
    String in question, since "self" came from m_m's frame and "s"
    came from the caller's scopes (m_m did not get its own scope).
    Removing the framing from m_m fixed the issue and did not
    introduce others (since that frame was not actually being used
    anymore).

    Fix JRUBY-6766
    
    --profile slows down Array#join , which distorts profiling results
    
    This turned out to be a really good find.
    
    In order to avoid the cost of dispatching to methods like
    respond_to? and method_missing for value coercion, we pre-cache
    those methods in org.jruby.Ruby and use identity checks to
    shortcut faster, non-dynamic logic. This works well during normal
    execution, but under profiling all method objects are wrapped
    with ProfilingDynamicMethod objects that do the profile gathering.
    Because the identity of the original method then becomes obscured
    by the wrapper (which is created on a per-class basis) we always
    followed the slow path. The slow path in the case of
    method_missing raises an exception, and the exception backtraces
    were the source of profiling slowdown.
    
    I modified DelegatingDynamicMethod, the superclass of
    ProfilingDynamicMethod, to override equals() to consider only the
    wrapped method and fixed all related == comparisons to use
    equals(), ensuring that regardless of which wrapper was
    encountered the identity of the method would not be obscured. This
    returned profiled performance for e.g. Array#join to normal
    levels.
    
    I should note that this fix improves profiling performance for all
    coercion paths and methods that do coercion, so it has far-
    reaching implications.
    
    Thanks for reporting this :)

    Fix JRUBY-6788: Missing prompt in rails console
    
    The issue here was that because we no longer launch child JRuby
    processes within the same JVM, the console process that Rails
    execs no longer had access to the TTY. This in turn caused it to
    switch to "inspect mode" and to have no proper console prompts.
    
    We had already started the move to a native exec by doing so on
    Windows. My change expands true native exec to posix platforms and
    adds a configuration option native.exec to disable the changed
    behavior and keep the "subprocess" within the same JVM.
    
    *Most* specs and tests pass, except for some new reopen failures
    due to our reopen not actually reusing the same file descriptor
    (it simulates reopening by swapping the NIO Channel being used by
    the given ChannelDescriptor instance. I don't think this
    regression is avoidable.

    Instead of always using Object when calling autoload from an

    but it should be correct for the majority of cases.

    Clean up autoload code.
    
    Something like refactoring, but it includes some modification such as
    removing unnecessary synchronized block.
    
    Added comments for Autoload class and related methods.
    
    In general, autoloadMap must be accessed after checking ConstantMap.
    Checking UNDEF value in constantMap works as a guard. For looking up
    constant, check constantMap first then try to get an Autoload object
    from autoloadMap.  For setting constant, update constantMap first and
    remove an Autoload object from autoloadMap.
    
    For more details about how we're treating Autoload objects, please see
    comments in this commit.

    Merged autoloadMap at LoadService and autoloadingMap at RubyModule.
    
    Before CRuby 1.8, autoload only supported toplevel constants. From 1.8,
    it started to support module constants. So there's no need to keep
    autoloadMap in global LoadService.
    
    I moved the map to RubyModule and merged it with autoloadingMap I added
    for this branch. It helps me adding proper synchronization around
    autoload resources.

    Make autoload thread-safe (in progress)
    
    Added autoloadingMap to RubyModule to keep an autoloading state. It
    consists of a RubyThread which invokes autoloading and an Object
    assigned to the autoload constant while autoloading.
    
    While autoloading, constantMap keeps UNDEF for the constant and
    autoloadingMap keeps the assigned object instead. Constant lookup checks
    if the value in constantMap is UNDEF, and iif it's UNDEF, it checks
    autloadingMap as well.
    
    It's still in development. For now, it passes
    org.jruby.test.ScriptTestSuite but org.jruby.test.JRubyTestSuite causes
    infinite loop. I'll check later.

    JRUBY-3194: Make autoload thread-safe.
    
    To make autoload thread-safe, remove loadMethod from loadService.autoloadMap after loading file, not before.
    Removing loadMethod before loading file would cause the second thread raising NameError since the target constant could not be defined yet.
    
    And this commit introduces 3 states as a resulting value of internal require method: LoadService#requireCommon()
     * LOADED ........... specified file is loaded.
     * ALREADY_LOADED ... specified file is already loaded.
     * CIRCULAR ......... circular require.
    
    For Kernel.require, ALREADY_LOADED and CIRCULAR are treated as 'false' as a resulting value.
    For Kenrel.autoload, when it gets CIRCULAR from requireCommon(), it returns nil instead of defined constant.
    CIRCULAR helps the following autoload situation.
    
      autoload :Java, 'java'
      require 'java' #=> 'module Java ...' => invoke autoload for :Java => circular require of 'java' => NameError since Java is not yet defined.
    
    NB: JRuby 1.6.1 does not have this circular autoload problem because 1.6.1 was using $LOADED_FEATURES for protecting runtime from threaded require.
    Recursive autoload just returns nil since the feature is marked as 'already loaded'.

    Fix JRUBY-5417: Nil backtrace when overriding method_missing and calling super
    
    Ok, the problem here is that with the "backtrace" branch work, it became a requirement that RaiseException must have its preRaise method called before getting thrown, so it would generate the Java backtrace. This matched Ruby semantics for Exception.new/raise lifecycle, but put the onus on Java-land exception creators to just know they had to make that call. In practice, nobody knows that, and even in JRuby several extensions were still not preRaise'ing.
    
    This particular case was caused by a separate logical path for method_missing fired in the "super" case. That path did not preRaise.
    
    I've decided to just force the preRaise call into the RaiseException constructors, so it is guaranteed to be there. This passes all tests and specs, and will fix this error plus many others as yet unreported. It also still mostly matches the Ruby lifecycle, since Exception.new does not create a RaiseException in Java...that doesn't happen until raise is actually called anyway.

    Merge "backtrace" branch to master, now that it runs clean on all our various test cases.
    
    This is a squashed merge encompassing the following commits from "backtrace":

    commit 32137decc9351dd7b6a19c49c7955808f535bb9c
    Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
    Date:   Wed Dec 1 09:41:29 2010 -0600
    
        Fix remaining failures for test-all.
    
        * Disable CheckClassAdapter temporarily, since it disallows what should be valid JVM identifiers.
        * Use the presence of $RUBY$ in method name as an additional indicator that we're processing a compiled Ruby body during backtrace gathering.
        * Move some largely-static properties out of "init" target in build.xml, so they're available whether init is triggered or not (e.g. run.jvm.model).

        Precompiled (AOT) specs *nearly* green.
    
        * Mark __method__ as reading frame "name"
        * Fix AOT-based stack trace mining logic

        Jitted specs running green.
    
        * eval needs to set method name into the binding, so it's there for "__method__" in the eval'ed code.
    
    commit fd442c0a815bcab9eb6c9aa1b71e1f8a260ee03b
    Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
    Date:   Mon Nov 29 16:06:53 2010 -0600
    
        Interpreted specs green on backtrace.
    
        * Tagged some __method__ specs for which backtrace behaves like 1.9, which Matz apparently likes but was afraid to backport. Odd cases anyway.
        * Fixed method name for the block used to define_method.
    
    commit cedb27e430b422c1158f66b4dcc7769922433506

    Date:   Sat Nov 6 00:32:59 2010 -0500
    
        More fixes to get specs and tests green on backtrace branch:
    
        * Hash#index was not being bound properly from RubyHash#index19
        * Range#min and Range#max need super, and therefore need frame = true
        * tc_owned is a bad test and fails on system like OS X where (for some reason) / may be owned by user
        * test_trace_func had been hacked for a bad class result (Integer, instead of Fixnum)...fixed that

        First fixes for backtrace branch in precompiled mode:
    
        * Add test-precompiled build target for running just precompiled
        * Eliminate extraneous toplevel scope being pushed for precompiled loads (because that logic is all in the generated "load" method now.
        * Add a new scope descriptor decoding path that properly sets up a toplevel scope

        Performance changes for backtrace logic:
    
        * Back off using Java stack trace for Proc's to_s file+line, since it's prohibitively expensive
        * Move the Backtrace stack to being a fixed-size array of objects updated, rather than created, when a push happens

        * Fixed a couple tests that are too sensitive to core method line numbers or expected only .rb elements in the trace
        * Added a mechanism for procs to retrieve the most recent Ruby frame, for to_s purposes
        * Added comments for hybrid backtrace logic

        Fixes for jitted/compiled backtrace generation
    
        * SClass in a method body needs to frame, so it has a jump target for non-local return

        * Synthetic calls, like to rescue bodies, need to gobble caller frames to avoid multiple entries

    * Fix all 1.9 Array specs (other than pack, which doesn't seem to run with Ruby 1.9 at the moment).
    * Backport 1.9's matrix to fix matrix failures
    * Merge over a ruby_1_8 set.rb fix (ruby bug #118)
    * Make Digests' #file raise EISDIR on dir
    * Update rubyspec and mspec and tag remaining failures
    * Kernel#require should expand ~
    * $? should be read-only

    Major refactoring of JRuby's launching code (Kernel's system/backquote/exec).
    
    - Created LaunchConfig class that keeps the launch configuration info.
    - Launcher code now aware of cmd.exe's built-in commands on Windows.
    - Ported MRI's has_redirection().
    - Properly handle BAT and CMD files: they should be launched in-shell.
    - Many new backquote tests, and make them pass on Windows and Linux.
    - Introduced jruby.debug.launch property for ShellLauncher logging.
    - Updated jruby --properties output
    - JRUBY-2253: Kernel#exec should raise Errno::ENOENT
      Based on patch by Riley Lynch (very useful, thanks!), further reworked and improved.
    - JRUBY-4213: ruby-debug-ide installation fails
    - JRUBY-4200: redirection issue in windows
    - JRUBY-2235: Kernel.system('non-existing-file') produces some output but shouldn't

    Multiple improvements for JRUBY-4117: RubyIO#incrementLineno is Very Slow
    
    I modified both $< and $. to be normal fields on org.jruby.Ruby, with the global var accessors just accessing them directly. This allows all places in the system that access them to go straight in rather than doing the global var hash lookup and constructing a RubyFixnum. I also modified the RubyArgsFile.setCurrentLineNumber to not dispatch back to lineno= and instead just update the int in the ArgsFileData structure. With these changes, we are trimming off the couple seconds RJ Lorimer mentioned in JRUBY-2810.

    Rejigger how binding works with files and line numbers. It appears that we weren't tracking everything we needed in a binding. Instead of holding the current frame plus the current file+line, we held only the current frame. This led to us constantly setting and clearing the frame's line numbers in an attempt to get traces to line up. With binding carrying the original file+line, that juggling is no longer necessary. This fixes an eval spec and should improve backtraces across eval calls, which had numerous peculiarities before. This also fixes JRUBY-2328: Overriding require causes eval to give wrong __FILE__ in certain circumstances.

    Full implementation of 1.9 Complex/Rational. Those classes are _very_ tightly integrated with the rest of core library (Nil, Kernel, String, and all Numeric descendants). Lots of default behaviors are dramatically changed (e.g. 10 ** -5 returns Rational instance now) so it might be difficult to test it all at once. 1.9 Complex and Rational classes are not rubyspec compatible, we fail then the same way 1.9 does (in 1.9 mode, though jruby should fake requiring Complex and Rational then). 1.8 mode should stay unaffected.

    The RC3 Surprise!
    
    Allow annotation defined ruby methods to optionally specify ThreadContext as first parameter
    Convert easiest and most common methods to accept ThreadContext when method or child method can use context
    
    These changes give about 15% improvement on petstore bench and about 10% in ar-bench.  In ar-bench getCurrentContext calls go from 14 million down to 2 million.  The remaining calls largely can be removed but they were much more invasive.
    
    IRubyObject op_eqq and op_equal both not have ThreadContext consumer, but we could see no use of this in any extensions and figured it worth the trouble of converting.

    This patch implements more than the above.  It also implements all of File::Stat, File::Test, Kernel#test, and all File posix methods (sans File.umask and File.readlink).  This is done via JNA and will work on Linux, Windows, and MacOS (32 bits).  64 bit systems require a little more work and Windows may be spotty (e.g. not as solid and Linux/MacOS).

    Remove "intern by default" from many call paths and explicitly intern only when the result will be passed to a method that requires interned strings. This should help reduce the amount of interning going on, easing some permgen pressure. The ultimate and best fix would be to forego interned strings in favor of an artificial ID.

    Remove two more IRubyObject methods:
    - getNativeTypeIndex moved to a separate interface; former uses now cast to that interface, rather than requiring all IRubyObject instances to specify a native type index directly. Marshalling should probably be refactored to not use this at all (and instead polymorphically dispatch to a method on the target object, similar to how it used to be).
    - isKindOf moved to RubyModule as isInstance and all references updated to use that version. This maps better to the type being in charge of what is or is not an instance, and mimics Java reflection API (Class#isInstance).

Date:   Sat Nov 24 11:27:21 2007 +0000

    A fairly extensive refactoring of the relationship between bindings, blocks, and eval. Binding holds the frame and *containing* scope; this allows the binding contained within a block to be use for evals directly, rather than requiring hacks like the previous commit. When a block is invoked, a new DynamicScope is constructed at that time, rather than having an existing scope cloned. Similarly for evals, the first time a binding is used getEvalScope is called on the binding's scope (the containing scope for the eval). This causes a new eval scope to be created the first time and used for subsequent calls with the same containing scope. And again, this avoids contortions when constructing the binding, since the binding only need to contain the unchanging containing scope.
    
    This should make it a lot easier to implement the remaining specific-size dynamic scopes. It also simplifies scoping/binding logic and fixes a number of eval/binding/scoping issues.

    A collection of fixes for some eval behavior that was slowing my DynScope work, and some tests to accompany them. I've discovered that the way we handle bindings in procs/blocks is wrong, though, so there's more coming.

    - Identified and extracted construction paths for class/module/singleton/IncludedModuleWrapper, now there's no unnecessary null checks or assignments in their constructors (they take very few arguments so even asserts are not needed).
    Each of those constructors have a comment what is it the responsible for, also, two RubyClass.newClass() and two RubyModule.newModule() methods have been extracted.
    - Fixed logic that sets the parent/constant for Modules, now matches MRI (only setConstant/getConstantAt are used here).
    - RubyClass rewritten, special attention has been put on allocation logic, now Class.new(...) doesn't fire a separate allocator class. (btw, logic of "class B < A;end" and "Class.new(A)" must be split since in second case superclass and allocator are not known until initialize is called). Class/Object allocation implementation mimics MRI's weirdest quirks in behavior, is _much_ simpler that it has been and much faster. This also allowed creation of generalized clone/dup implementations matching MRI. (only our special ivars need a care here).
    - Rewritten bootstrapping of Object/Class/Module.
    - Core classes (except Exception hierarchy, they should also be in future) are now cached in runtime (MRI caches them in static VALUE's like rb_cObject) Ruby.getClass(String), Ruby.getModule(String) and Ruby.getClassFromPath(String) should be used only by either interpreter or compiler and when the class name is not known at compile time.
    - Fixed and simplified nodes: classNode, moduleNode, sclassNode, defsNode. Compiler has been synchronized here as well.
    - No more __attached__ as ivar, it is now MetaClass field (which means lazy ivars for singletons). Compiler also updated.
    - added and dosumented isModule() to IRubyObject (isClass(), isSintleton() documented).
    - Fixed test_autoload test (Object.class_eval do;autoload :SomeClass, 'somefile';class SomeClass; end;end) should raise LoadError, now matches MRI.
    
    - Fixed a number of minor bugs:
       1.instance_eval, was creating a metaclass for Fixnum instances (also affected Symbol/FalseClass/TrueClass/NilClass)
       marshaler objects were kept in singleton classes
       Range.inspect, was modifying the begin field (when it was a String)
       Many bulletproofings in Marshal/Unmarshal (like unmarshaling an instance of nonexistant class), TypeErrors/ArgumentErrors matching MRI.
       Fiber.new in 1.9, doesn't call #initialize method by funcall, fixed
       number of method arity fixes and many methods are made fast now
       fixed initialize/initialize_copy logic, further simplification, no ClassCastExceptions possible now
       Fixed defineClass(under)/defineModule(under) logic
       bulletproofed cases such: class A;end;module A;end

    The Bill Dortch sprintf special commit....
    
    JRUBY-667: String#to_f and Float(str) do not support MRI behavior
    JRUBY-609: PrintfFormat needs to be completely rewritten
    JRUBY-39: Floating point formatting discrepancy: "%02f" % '5'
    JRUBY-581: Kernel.(format|sprintf) does not correspond to MRI's behaviour
    JRUBY-678: RubyBignum test assertion failure in build 3151
    
    In addition to this fix I also removed old PrintfFormat and a few stragglers...There could be some follow work in method_missing in RubyObject and RubyKernel since I removed those old printfformat consumers in a pretty innefficient way.
    
    Thanks Bill it is great stuff!!!

    - Create a NULL_BLOCK to replace null checks against blocks:
      - Now isGiven() on a block tells you whether it is supplied or not
      - yield on the NULL_BLOCK throw the correct exception
        - We were not throwing this correctly by most callers with my landing of
          the block branch
        - We were generating NPE in cases where we called something that requires
          a block and supply none
    - Block.blockObject => Block.proc
     - Rename and type since this is just a convenience reference for association
       from block to what proc it might represent
    - Remove unused blockAtCreation (this may become relevent for Ruby 2 but why do
      it now
    - Remove ThreadContext and IRuby from Frame
    - Remove Scope
    - Put Visibility directly on Frame
    - callingzsuper dead code
    - Now that modules have a proper superclass we can get rid of special code in
      callSuper
    - ArgsPushNode.childNodes should not return null

    Nice, simple fix for the marshal failure on modules for JRUBY-472. Modules that define public functions *do* need a singleton class on which to define them, since their metaclass is Module (and obviously we can't be defining a bunch of public class methods on Module). Left the singletonizing alone, but when the singleton classes are created, I ensure they have the same ClassIndex as the metaclass they're created from, so marshalling works correctly.

    Big set of changes for marshalling bug JRUBY-472; getting closer to having things sorted out. One known failure in "ant
    test" is due to our modules defining methods on a singleton class, which appears to be incorrect and harder to fix. I'm
    on it though.

    Fix for JRUBY-216, an implementation of Kernel#abort that uses an MainExitException to stop running. This is better than System.exit, because the runtime will be shut down correctly, and at the same time, if more than one runtime is running, this will not affect them.

    Reverted bad "call" dispatching for internal String behavior. The resulting code is fairly ugly (lots of casting and encapsulation-busting) but I'll remedy that before converting any more methods.

    Consistency of Libraries (since I want to make a new one and have it follow similiar conventions to the others):
    - Remove ILoadService and LoadServiceFactory (file under your are not gonna need it [YANGNI])
    - Rename and move libraries so they use the same conventions for names and locations
      - Mutex becomes RubyMutex (like BasicSocket)
      - RbConfig becomes RbConfigLibrary
      - SocketLibrary moved to same package as other libraries

    More moving towards java.util.Stack contract for remaining Abstract Stack users
    args are never null (we no longer null check with a few strategic asserts)
    getPosition() always returns something from Nodes (we no longer null check)
