    Optimizations to proc invocation to reduce allocation.
    
    * Do not clone block if we aren't modifying frame self
    * Do not create intermediate lists for 1.9 args setup
    * Use preallocated, frozen Array for intermediate Array of size 0

    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

commit 330fef3b0fc18af477ccea19bd278669667f31bb
Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 12 14:49:29 2013 -0600

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

        Fix remaining failures for test-all.
    
        * Disable CheckClassAdapter temporarily, since it disallows what should be valid JVM identifiers.
        * Use the presence of $RUBY$ in method name as an additional indicator that we're processing a compiled Ruby body during backtrace gathering.
        * Move some largely-static properties out of "init" target in build.xml, so they're available whether init is triggered or not (e.g. run.jvm.model).

        * Fixed method name for the block used to define_method.

        * Hash#index was not being bound properly from RubyHash#index19
        * Range#min and Range#max need super, and therefore need frame = true
        * tc_owned is a bad test and fails on system like OS X where (for some reason) / may be owned by user
        * test_trace_func had been hacked for a bad class result (Integer, instead of Fixnum)...fixed that

        * Add a new scope descriptor decoding path that properly sets up a toplevel scope

        * Remove break handling from non-literal block call paths in CachingCallSite

        * Fix a bad test in testCompiler that needed visibility tweaks and framing
        * Add complete doco for CallSite
        * Fix Kernel#caller to trim from top of stack instead of bottom

        Fixes to get test-compiled (but not precompiled) passing 100%.
    
        * Fix eqlInternal's RubyNumeric branch check if classes are equal
        * Provide file and line from all BlockBodies, so Proc#to_s can always use it
        * Fix rejiggered Struct#each and Struct#each_pair to call the appropriate internal version
        * Fix ruby_test's IO.new suite to not use STDOUT directly, risking that it get closed

        Performance changes for backtrace logic:
    
        * Back off using Java stack trace for Proc's to_s file+line, since it's prohibitively expensive
        * Move the Backtrace stack to being a fixed-size array of objects updated, rather than created, when a push happens

        * Fixed a couple tests that are too sensitive to core method line numbers or expected only .rb elements in the trace
        * Added a mechanism for procs to retrieve the most recent Ruby frame, for to_s purposes
        * Added comments for hybrid backtrace logic

        Add better logging to AnnotationBinder (for showing framed/scoped core methods), ASTInspector (for showing methods detected as framed/scoped and for reporting deopt flags as they are set), and JITCompiler (for dumping jitted methods' full classes and inspector results).

        Fixes for jitted/compiled backtrace generation
    
        * SClass in a method body needs to frame, so it has a jump target for non-local return
        * Compiled methods need to always have their ruby name in the method name, so it can be mined out appropriately
        * Synthetic calls, like to rescue bodies, need to gobble caller frames to avoid multiple entries

    Bombs away! Eliinate nodeId field from Node and add a method to all nodes of interest to return the value instead. Probably a little slower, but we're moving away from using NodeType on critical path code and the memory savings are pretty substantial (4-8 bytes per node).

    Implement Vladimir's silly Integer#times perf hack, avoiding instantiating fixnums when the block takes no args. About 25% faster for a simple .times { 1 } loop benchmark.

    Refactor interpreted blocks in same way as compiled blocks to simplify them, reduce method size, improve inlining potential. Also some additional cleanup of compiled block.

    A fairly extensive refactoring of the relationship between bindings, blocks, and eval. Binding holds the frame and *containing* scope; this allows the binding contained within a block to be use for evals directly, rather than requiring hacks like the previous commit. When a block is invoked, a new DynamicScope is constructed at that time, rather than having an existing scope cloned. Similarly for evals, the first time a binding is used getEvalScope is called on the binding's scope (the containing scope for the eval). This causes a new eval scope to be created the first time and used for subsequent calls with the same containing scope. And again, this avoids contortions when constructing the binding, since the binding only need to contain the unchanging containing scope.
    
    This should make it a lot easier to implement the remaining specific-size dynamic scopes. It also simplifies scoping/binding logic and fixes a number of eval/binding/scoping issues.
