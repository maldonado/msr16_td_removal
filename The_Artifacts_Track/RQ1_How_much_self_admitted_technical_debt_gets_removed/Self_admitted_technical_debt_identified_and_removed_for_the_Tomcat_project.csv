 *  CGI-invoking servlet for web applications, used to execute scripts which
 *  comply to the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specification and are named
 *  in the path-info used to invoke this servlet.
 *
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: This code compiles and even works for simple CGI cases.
 *          Exhaustive testing has not been done.  Please consider it beta
 *          quality.  Feedback is appreciated to the author (see below).</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Example</b>:<br>
 * If an instance of this servlet was mapped (using
 *       <code>&lt;web-app&gt;/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>) to:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/*
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * then the following request:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * http://localhost:8080/&lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/dir1/script/pathinfo1
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * would result in the execution of the script
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;web-app-root&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi/dir1/script
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * with the script's <code>PATH_INFO</code> set to <code>/pathinfo1</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Recommendation:  House all your CGI scripts under
 * <code>&lt;webapp&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi</code>.  This will ensure that you do not
 * accidentally expose your cgi scripts' code to the outside world and that
 * your cgis will be cleanly ensconced underneath the WEB-INF (i.e.,
 * non-content) area.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default CGI location is mentioned above.  You have the flexibility to
 * put CGIs wherever you want, however:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The CGI search path will start at
 *   webAppRootDir + File.separator + cgiPathPrefix
 *   (or webAppRootDir alone if cgiPathPrefix is
 *   null).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   cgiPathPrefix is defined by setting
 *   this servlet's cgiPathPrefix init parameter
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <B>CGI Specification</B>:<br> derived from
 * <a href=""http://cgi-spec.golux.com"">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>.
 * A work-in-progress &amp; expired Internet Draft.  Note no actual RFC describing
 * the CGI specification exists.  Where the behavior of this servlet differs
 * from the specification cited above, it is either documented here, a bug,
 * or an instance where the specification cited differs from Best
 * Community Practice (BCP).
 * Such instances should be well-documented here.  Please email the
 * <a href=""mailto:dev@tomcat.apache.org"">Tomcat group [dev@tomcat.apache.org]</a>
 * with amendments.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Canonical metavariables</b>:<br>
 * The CGI specification defines the following canonical metavariables:
 * <br>
 * [excerpt from CGI specification]
 * <PRE>
 *  AUTH_TYPE
 *  CONTENT_LENGTH
 *  CONTENT_TYPE
 *  GATEWAY_INTERFACE
 *  PATH_INFO
 *  PATH_TRANSLATED
 *  QUERY_STRING
 *  REMOTE_ADDR
 *  REMOTE_HOST
 *  REMOTE_IDENT
 *  REMOTE_USER
 *  REQUEST_METHOD
 *  SCRIPT_NAME
 *  SERVER_NAME
 *  SERVER_PORT
 *  SERVER_PROTOCOL
 *  SERVER_SOFTWARE
 * </PRE>
 * <p>
 * Metavariables with names beginning with the protocol name (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
 * ""HTTP_ACCEPT"") are also canonical in their description of request header
 * fields.  The number and meaning of these fields may change independently
 * of this specification.  (See also section 6.1.5 [of the CGI specification].)
 * </p>
 * [end excerpt]
 *
 * <h2> Implementation notes</h2>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input,
 * then the client must start sending input within a certain timeout period,
 * otherwise the servlet will assume no input is coming and carry on running
 * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of
 * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be
 * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable, then this servlet needs
 * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin, stdout,
 * and stderr (which should not be too hard).
 * <br>
 * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input, you can set
 * the init parameter <code></code> of your webapps' cgi-handling servlet
 * to be
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specification,
 * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an
 * implementation-specific manner, but must define that manner.  This
 * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables, but
 * set the value to """" for all metavariables whose value is either null or
 * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule, as per the
 * CGI Specification.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does
 * not support the CGI NPH concept, whereby server ensures that the data
 * supplied to the script are precisely as supplied by the client and
 * unaltered by the server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically
 * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables, and as
 * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output.
 * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally
 * compliant.  Thus, this implementation maintains unconditional compliance
 * with the specification though NPH support is not present.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * The CGI specification is located at
 * <a href=""http://cgi-spec.golux.com"">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>TODO:</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Support for setting headers (for example, Location headers don't work)
 * <li> Support for collapsing multiple header lines (per RFC 2616)
 * <li> Ensure handling of POST method does not interfere with 2.3 Filters
 * <li> Refactor some debug code out of core
 * <li> Ensure header handling preserves encoding
 * <li> Possibly rewrite CGIRunner.run()?
 * <li> Possibly refactor CGIRunner and CGIEnvironment as non-inner classes?
 * <li> Document handling of cgi stdin when there is no stdin
 * <li> Revisit IOException handling in CGIRunner.run()
 * <li> Better documentation
 * <li> Confirm use of ServletInputStream.available() in CGIRunner.run() is
 *      not needed
 * <li> [add more to this TODO list]

 * Any state can transition to FAILED.
 * 
 * Calling start() while a component is in states STARTING_PREP, STARTING or

 * Calling start() while a component is in state NEW will cause init() to be
 * called immediately after the start() method is entered.
 * 
 * Calling stop() while a component is in states STOPPING_PREP, STOPPING or
 * STOPPED has no effect.
 * 
 * Calling stop() while a component is in state NEW transitions the component
 * to STOPPED. This is typically encountered when a component fails to start and
 * does not start all its sub-components. When the component is stopped, it will
 * try to stop all sub-components - even those it didn't start.
 * 
 * MUST_STOP is used to indicate that the {@link #stop()} should be called on
 * the component as soon as {@link #start()} exits. It is typically used when a
 * component has failed to start.
 * 
 * MUST_DESTROY is used to indicate that the {@link #stop()} should be called on
 * the component as soon as {@link #stop()} exits. It is typically used when a
 * component is not designed to be restarted.
 * 
 * Attempting any other transition will throw {@link LifecycleException}.
 * 
 * </pre>
 * The {@link LifecycleEvent}s fired during state changes are defined in the
 * methods that trigger the changed. No {@link LifecycleEvent}s are fired if the
 * attempted transition is not valid.

 * Link between JNDI and JMX. JNDI can be used for persistence ( it is
 * an API for storing hierarchical data and a perfect fit for that ), as
 * well as an alternate view of the MBean registry.
 *
 * If this component is enabled, all MBeans will be registered in JNDI, and
 * all attributes that are set via JMX can be stored in a DirContext.
 *
 * This acts as a ""recorder"" for creation of mbeans and attribute changes
 * done via JMX.
 *
 * XXX How can we control ( filter ) which mbeans will be registere ? Or
 * attributes ?
 * XXX How can we get the beans and attributes loaded before jndijmx ?
 *
 * The intended use:
 * - do whatever you want to start the application
 * - load JndiJmx as an mbean
 * - make changes via JMX. All changes are recorded
 * - you can use JndiJmx to save the changes in a Jndi context.
 * - you can use JndiJmx to load changes from a JndiContext and replay them.
 *
 * The main benefit is that only changed attributes are saved, and the Jndi
 * layer can preserve most of the original structure of the config file. The
 * alternative is to override the config files with config info extracted
 * from the live objects - but it's very hard to save only what was actually
 * changed and preserve structure and comments.

 *
 * <b>Canonical metavariables</b>:<br>
 * The CGI specification defines the following canonical metavariables:
 * <br>
 * [excerpt from CGI specification]
 * <PRE>
 *  AUTH_TYPE
 *  CONTENT_LENGTH
 *  CONTENT_TYPE
 *  GATEWAY_INTERFACE
 *  PATH_INFO
 *  PATH_TRANSLATED
 *  QUERY_STRING
 *  REMOTE_ADDR
 *  REMOTE_HOST
 *  REMOTE_IDENT
 *  REMOTE_USER
 *  REQUEST_METHOD
 *  SCRIPT_NAME
 *  SERVER_NAME
 *  SERVER_PORT
 *  SERVER_PROTOCOL
 *  SERVER_SOFTWARE
 * </PRE>
 * <p>
 * Metavariables with names beginning with the protocol name (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
 * ""HTTP_ACCEPT"") are also canonical in their description of request header
 * fields.  The number and meaning of these fields may change independently
 * of this specification.  (See also section 6.1.5 [of the CGI specification].)
 * </p>
 * [end excerpt]
 *
 * </p>
 * <h2> Implementation notes</h2>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input,
 * then the client must start sending input within a certain timeout period,
 * otherwise the servlet will assume no input is coming and carry on running
 * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of
 * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be
 * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable, then this servlet needs
 * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin, stdout,
 * and stderr (which should not be too hard).
 * <br>
 * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input, you can set
 * the init parameter <code></code> of your webapps' cgi-handling servlet
 * to be
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specification,
 * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an
 * implementation-specific manner, but must define that manner.  This
 * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables, but
 * set the value to """" for all metavariables whose value is either null or
 * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule, as per the
 * CGI Specification.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does
 * not support the CGI NPH concept, whereby server ensures that the data
 * supplied to the script are precisely as supplied by the client and
 * unaltered by the server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically
 * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables, and as
 * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output.
 * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally
 * compliant.  Thus, this implementation maintains unconditional compliance
 * with the specification though NPH support is not present.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * The CGI specification is located at
 * <a href=""http://cgi-spec.golux.com"">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>TODO:</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Support for setting headers (for example, Location headers don't work)
 * <li> Support for collapsing multiple header lines (per RFC 2616)
 * <li> Ensure handling of POST method does not interfere with 2.3 Filters
 * <li> Refactor some debug code out of core
 * <li> Ensure header handling preserves encoding
 * <li> Possibly rewrite CGIRunner.run()?
 * <li> Possibly refactor CGIRunner and CGIEnvironment as non-inner classes?
 * <li> Document handling of cgi stdin when there is no stdin
 * <li> Revisit IOException handling in CGIRunner.run()
 * <li> Better documentation
 * <li> Confirm use of ServletInputStream.available() in CGIRunner.run() is
 *      not needed
 * <li> [add more to this TODO list]

 * <B>CGI Specification</B>:<br> derived from
 * <a href=""http://cgi-spec.golux.com"">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>.
 * A work-in-progress &amp; expired Internet Draft.  Note no actual RFC describing
 * the CGI specification exists.  Where the behavior of this servlet differs
 * from the specification cited above, it is either documented here, a bug,
 * or an instance where the specification cited differs from Best
 * Community Practice (BCP).
 * Such instances should be well-documented here.  Please email the
 * <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html"">Tomcat group</a>
 * with amendments.

 *
 * <b>Canonical metavariables</b>:<br>
 * The CGI specification defines the following canonical metavariables:
 * <br>
 * [excerpt from CGI specification]
 * <PRE>
 *  AUTH_TYPE
 *  CONTENT_LENGTH
 *  CONTENT_TYPE
 *  GATEWAY_INTERFACE
 *  PATH_INFO
 *  PATH_TRANSLATED
 *  QUERY_STRING
 *  REMOTE_ADDR
 *  REMOTE_HOST
 *  REMOTE_IDENT
 *  REMOTE_USER
 *  REQUEST_METHOD
 *  SCRIPT_NAME
 *  SERVER_NAME
 *  SERVER_PORT
 *  SERVER_PROTOCOL
 *  SERVER_SOFTWARE
 * </PRE>
 * <p>
 * Metavariables with names beginning with the protocol name (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
 * ""HTTP_ACCEPT"") are also canonical in their description of request header
 * fields.  The number and meaning of these fields may change independently
 * of this specification.  (See also section 6.1.5 [of the CGI specification].)
 * </p>
 * [end excerpt]
 *
 * <h2> Implementation notes</h2>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input,
 * then the client must start sending input within a certain timeout period,
 * otherwise the servlet will assume no input is coming and carry on running
 * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of
 * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be
 * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable, then this servlet needs
 * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin, stdout,
 * and stderr (which should not be too hard).
 * <br>
 * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input, you can set
 * the init parameter <code>stderrTimeout</code> of your webapps' cgi-handling
 * servlet.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specification,
 * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an
 * implementation-specific manner, but must define that manner.  This
 * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables, but
 * set the value to """" for all metavariables whose value is either null or
 * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule, as per the
 * CGI Specification.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does
 * not support the CGI NPH concept, whereby server ensures that the data
 * supplied to the script are precisely as supplied by the client and
 * unaltered by the server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically
 * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables, and as
 * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output.
 * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally
 * compliant.  Thus, this implementation maintains unconditional compliance
 * with the specification though NPH support is not present.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * The CGI specification is located at
 * <a href=""http://cgi-spec.golux.com"">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>.
 *
 * </p>
 * <h3>TODO:</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Support for setting headers (for example, Location headers don't work)
 * <li> Support for collapsing multiple header lines (per RFC 2616)
 * <li> Ensure handling of POST method does not interfere with 2.3 Filters
 * <li> Refactor some debug code out of core
 * <li> Ensure header handling preserves encoding
 * <li> Possibly rewrite CGIRunner.run()?
 * <li> Possibly refactor CGIRunner and CGIEnvironment as non-inner classes?
 * <li> Document handling of cgi stdin when there is no stdin
 * <li> Revisit IOException handling in CGIRunner.run()
 * <li> Better documentation
 * <li> Confirm use of ServletInputStream.available() in CGIRunner.run() is
 *      not needed
 * <li> [add more to this TODO list]
 * </ul>

 *  CGI-invoking servlet for web applications, used to execute scripts which
 *  comply to the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specification and are named

 *
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: This code compiles and even works for simple CGI cases.
 *          Exhaustive testing has not been done.  Please consider it beta
 *          quality.  Feedback is appreciated to the author (see below).</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Example</b>:<br>
 * If an instance of this servlet was mapped (using
 *       <code>&lt;web-app&gt;/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>) to:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/*
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * then the following request:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * http://localhost:8080/&lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/dir1/script/pathinfo1
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * would result in the execution of the script
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;web-app-root&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi/dir1/script
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * with the script's <code>PATH_INFO</code> set to <code>/pathinfo1</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Recommendation:  House all your CGI scripts under
 * <code>&lt;webapp&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi</code>.  This will ensure that you do not
 * accidentally expose your cgi scripts' code to the outside world and that
 * your cgis will be cleanly ensconced underneath the WEB-INF (i.e.,
 * non-content) area.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default CGI location is mentioned above.  You have the flexibility to
 * put CGIs wherever you want, however:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The CGI search path will start at
 *   webAppRootDir + File.separator + cgiPathPrefix
 *   (or webAppRootDir alone if cgiPathPrefix is
 *   null).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   cgiPathPrefix is defined by setting
 *   this servlet's cgiPathPrefix init parameter
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <B>CGI Specification</B>:<br> derived from
 * <a href=""http://cgi-spec.golux.com"">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>.
 * A work-in-progress & expired Internet Draft.  Note no actual RFC describing
 * the CGI specification exists.  Where the behavior of this servlet differs
 * from the specification cited above, it is either documented here, a bug,
 * or an instance where the specification cited differs from Best
 * Community Practice (BCP).
 * Such instances should be well-documented here.  Please email the
 * <a href=""mailto:dev@tomcat.apache.org"">Tomcat group [dev@tomcat.apache.org]</a>
 * with amendments.

 *
 * <b>Canonical metavariables</b>:<br>
 * The CGI specification defines the following canonical metavariables:
 * <br>
 * [excerpt from CGI specification]
 * <PRE>
 *  AUTH_TYPE
 *  CONTENT_LENGTH
 *  CONTENT_TYPE
 *  GATEWAY_INTERFACE
 *  PATH_INFO
 *  PATH_TRANSLATED
 *  QUERY_STRING
 *  REMOTE_ADDR
 *  REMOTE_HOST
 *  REMOTE_IDENT
 *  REMOTE_USER
 *  REQUEST_METHOD
 *  SCRIPT_NAME
 *  SERVER_NAME
 *  SERVER_PORT
 *  SERVER_PROTOCOL
 *  SERVER_SOFTWARE
 * </PRE>
 * <p>
 * Metavariables with names beginning with the protocol name (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
 * ""HTTP_ACCEPT"") are also canonical in their description of request header
 * fields.  The number and meaning of these fields may change independently
 * of this specification.  (See also section 6.1.5 [of the CGI specification].)
 * </p>
 * [end excerpt]
 *
 * </p>
 * <h2> Implementation notes</h2>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input,
 * then the client must start sending input within a certain timeout period,
 * otherwise the servlet will assume no input is coming and carry on running
 * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of
 * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be
 * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable, then this servlet needs
 * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin, stdout,
 * and stderr (which should not be too hard).
 * <br>
 * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input, you can set
 * the init parameter <code></code> of your webapps' cgi-handling servlet
 * to be
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specification,
 * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an
 * implementation-specific manner, but must define that manner.  This
 * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables, but
 * set the value to """" for all metavariables whose value is either null or
 * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule, as per the
 * CGI Specification.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does
 * not support the CGI NPH concept, whereby server ensures that the data
 * supplied to the script are precisely as supplied by the client and
 * unaltered by the server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically
 * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables, and as
 * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output.
 * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally
 * compliant.  Thus, this implementation maintains unconditional compliance
 * with the specification though NPH support is not present.
 * </p>
 * <p>

 * <h3>TODO:</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Support for setting headers (for example, Location headers don't work)
 * <li> Support for collapsing multiple header lines (per RFC 2616)
 * <li> Ensure handling of POST method does not interfere with 2.3 Filters
 * <li> Refactor some debug code out of core
 * <li> Ensure header handling preserves encoding
 * <li> Possibly rewrite CGIRunner.run()?
 * <li> Possibly refactor CGIRunner and CGIEnvironment as non-inner classes?
 * <li> Document handling of cgi stdin when there is no stdin
 * <li> Revisit IOException handling in CGIRunner.run()
 * <li> Better documentation
 * <li> Confirm use of ServletInputStream.available() in CGIRunner.run() is
 *      not needed
 * <li> [add more to this TODO list]

 * <h2> Implementation notes</h2>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input,

 * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of
 * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be
 * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable, then this servlet needs
 * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin, stdout,
 * and stderr (which should not be too hard).
 * <br>
 * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input, you can set
 * the init parameter <code></code> of your webapps' cgi-handling servlet
 * to be
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specificion,
 * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an
 * implementation-specific manner, but must define that manner.  This
 * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables, but
 * set the value to """" for all metavariables whose value is either null or
 * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule, as per the
 * CGI Specification.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does
 * not support the CGI NPH concept, whereby server ensures that the data
 * supplied to the script are preceisely as supplied by the client and
 * unaltered by the server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically
 * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables, and as
 * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output.
 * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally
 * compliant.  Thus, this implementation maintains unconditional compliance
 * with the specification though NPH support is not present.

 * <h2> Implementation notes</h2>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input,
 * then the client must start sending input within a certain timeout period,
 * otherwise the servlet will assume no input is coming and carry on running
 * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of
 * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be
 * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable, then this servlet needs
 * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin, stdout,
 * and stderr (which should not be too hard).
 * <br>
 * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input, you can set
 * the init parameter <code></code> of your webapps' cgi-handling servlet
 * to be
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specificion,
 * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an
 * implementation-specific manner, but must define that manner.  This
 * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables, but
 * set the value to """" for all metavariables whose value is either null or
 * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule, as per the
 * CGI Specification.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does
 * not support the CGI NPH concept, whereby server ensures that the data
 * supplied to the script are preceisely as supplied by the client and
 * unaltered by the server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically
 * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables, and as
 * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output.
 * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally
 * compliant.  Thus, this implementation maintains unconditional compliance
 * with the specification though NPH support is not present.
 * </p>

 * <h3>TODO:</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Support for setting headers (for example, Location headers don't work)
 * <li> Support for collapsing multiple header lines (per RFC 2616)
 * <li> Ensure handling of POST method does not interfere with 2.3 Filters
 * <li> Refactor some debug code out of core
 * <li> Ensure header handling preserves encoding
 * <li> Possibly rewrite CGIRunner.run()?
 * <li> Possibly refactor CGIRunner and CGIEnvironment as non-inner classes?
 * <li> Document handling of cgi stdin when there is no stdin
 * <li> Revisit IOException handling in CGIRunner.run()
 * <li> Better documentation
 * <li> Confirm use of ServletInputStream.available() in CGIRunner.run() is
 *      not needed
 * <li> Make checking for ""."" and "".."" in servlet & cgi PATH_INFO less
 *      draconian
 * <li> [add more to this TODO list]
